TSpec is a non-English behaviour-driven development (BDD) framework, designed for Thai language.
It is written in Groovy, running on JVM, and working with both Groovy and Java programs.
According to Wikipeia, TSpec seems to be the first non-English BDD framework (but it is not a strong claim here).

TSpec comes with 2 modes, as a stand-lone program and a Grails plugin.
